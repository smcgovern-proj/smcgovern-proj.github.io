# Intro
Welcome to my portfolio website! I built it partly out of a desire to learn how to use [Svelte](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte) and partly out of pure, unadulterated vanity. 

# Design Process
Before I did any coding I started with a wireframe. I went through several iterations, at first thinking my website would need a popout menu, a navbar, etc. I even considered client-side routing to multiple pages at one point.
